download the data.csv file in order to have all of the necessary data to run the computations in the python file. once that's done, download the .py file which contains all of the code for each of the analysis questions, seperated by a commented dashed line in the code itself. to run the code for a specific problem, simply comment out everything either above/below the desired code and click the run button. MAKE SURE that both the code and the data required are in the workspace to make it run well.
